Keybinds:
|Key | Action |
|----|--------|
|g   | Grab   |
|x/X | Translate +- x |
|y/Y | Translate +- y |
|z/Z | Translate +- z |

You can figure out the rest :)

Something I'm sort of proud of is the Transform system with string-indexed children which describe a position and rotation, among other things.

Have fun!

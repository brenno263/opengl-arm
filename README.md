My coordinate system is a little different to the one described in the instructions, but I think I was able to emulate all the required behaviors nonetheless. Additionally, hit the 'g' key to toggle a grab.

Something I'm sort of proud of is the Transform system with string-indexed children which describe a position and rotation, among other things.

Have fun!
